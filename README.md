Hello GH, I have released a final version of the Matrix legacy menu, any previous code has been re-written, reasons due to the old developer implemented some law-breaking lines of code, i have since found those and amended any insecurities in the program, Enjoy!

This is just a foundation or blueprint for a multi purpose lobby tool menu, equipped with both host and off-host options, force host from Lucid v1.3, but pared with [Nexvein for MW2](https://github.com/Zcxq/MW2-ACSM-Source)'s force host, you have the best menu for hosting and conquering the loobbies.

Detours are what make compilations possible, without these you will not be able to construct the .dll or .exe for the program, you can find the detours by clicking [here](). 

Detours are to be placed in your `VS2019` file folders, proceed with placing `Detours.lib` in any Lib (Library) folder, then relocate the `Detours.h` file to all header or include folders. if done correctly you should be able to build .dll in both x86 and x64 release and debug, debug is for testing purposes only, releasing a debug build publically will most likely cause game crashes when using/injecting said .dll
