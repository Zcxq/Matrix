Hello GH, I have released a final version of the Matrix legacy menu, any previous code has been re-written, reasons due to the old developer implemented some law-breaking lines of code, i have since found those and amended any insecurities in the program, Enkoy!

This is just a foundation or blueprint for a multi purpose lobby tool menu, equipped with both host and off-host options, force host from Lucid v1.3, but pared with [Nexvein for MW2](https://github.com/Zcxq/MW2-ACSM-Source)'s force host, you have the best menu for hosting and conquering the loobbies.
